  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <h2>Preamble</h2>
  Dear reader,
  <br><br>
  You have probably already noticed that my website doesn't contain any flashing 
  css styles or heavy js plugins. This is intentional since I want to enable
  anyone to access my page whether they are using a 20 year old personal computer,
  are connected to a 2G network or are using text to speech software. Also,
  this should give you a rough idea what kind of person I am and what I usually
  strive for when I write professional code. 

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  I am Marko Petrlic, a mid-twenties guy who currently lives in Cork (Ireland). 
  I like to play video games (World of Warcraft, Dota 2, Crusader Kings),
  I enjoy running, baking low calorie cakes (cheesecake mostly) and
  reading about space, atoms, single-celled organisms.
  
  <h2>What I do?</h2>
  In order to pay my rent I write C++ code and though (not) so many years of
  programming the following tools/technologies I have used:
  <ul>
    <li>Version control systems: Git, Vault</li>
    <li>GUI tools: Qt, Embedded Wizard Studio</li>
    <li>IDEs: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code</li>
    <li>Other programs: StarTeam, EasyReadMind, </li>

  </ul>
